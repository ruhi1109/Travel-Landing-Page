                <h1>Sahara</h1>
                <p>The Sahara will surprise you. For one thing, it’s probably bigger than you think. The largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara occupies roughly 10 African countries, and is roughly the size of the States. Another thing – the Sahara isn’t always hot. Algeria’s dunes sometimes get dusted with snow. And it’s barely sandy: in fact, the Sahara is mostly stony plateau. Get to know this misunderstood monster with our Sahara travel guide. </p>
